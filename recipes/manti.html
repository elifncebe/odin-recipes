        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Manti is a type of dumpling mainly found in Turkish cuisine, Armenian cuisine and Central Asian cuisine but also in West Asia, South Caucasus, and the Balkans. The dumplings typically consist of a spiced meat mixture, usually lamb or ground beef, wrapped in a thin dough sheet which is then boiled or steamed. The size and shape of manti vary significantly depending on geographic location. (Wikipedia)</p>

        </ul>

        <p>These ingredients can vary slightly depending on the recipe</p>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make dough: Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Add eggs and water, mixing well with your hands. Add more water, if needed, to form a soft dough. Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make filling: Shred onions and place them in a colander or sieve set over a bowl; drain and discard juice. Combine drained onion, ground beef, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; mix well with a spoon until mashed. Set filling aside.</li>
        <li>Lightly flour a work surface and a large plate.</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half. Working with one piece at a time, roll dough on the floured surface into a rectangle as thin as possible. Cut into 2-inch squares using a knife or pastry wheel.</li>
        <li>Place about 2 teaspoons filling in the center of each square. Gather the edges of dough and pinch them together at the top to form a bundle. Transfer manti to the prepared plate; sprinkle more flour on top to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Make oil: Heat oil and paste in a small skillet over low heat just until the ingredients begin to color oil. Remove from heat and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Make garlic yogurt: Stir together yogurt and garlic in a small bowl, add salt if needed; set aside.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook manti in boiling water until filling is no longer pink and dough is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain well.</li>
        <li>After your manti is done cooking and plated, spoon yogurt over manti and drizzle with spiced oil. Add garnishes as you wish!</li>
    </ol>
