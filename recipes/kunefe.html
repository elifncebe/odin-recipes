        <p>These ingredients can vary slightly depending on the recipe</p>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium pot, bring the sugar and water to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until the sugar is dissolved and the liquid is starting to thicken slightly, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the lemon juice and simmer for another 1-2 minutes to blend the flavors.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Generously grease 4-6 individual or one large stove-safe pans with half the butter (they will be greased again before flipping the pastries).</li>
        <li>Roughly chop the Kadayıf into 1 inch (2.5 centimeter) pieces and place in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour the melted butter over the chopped Kadayıf and toss to thoroughly coat.</li>
        <li>Press a layer of the coated Kadayıf across the bottom and sides of the prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Cover each layer of pastry with a layer of the cheese, leaving about a 1/2 inch (1.25 centimeter) border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Cover the cheese with another layer of the Kadayif. Press down to completely enclose the layer of cheese, especially around the sides.</li>
        <li>Place the pan over medium low heat. Cook until the bottom is golden, adjusting the heat between medium and low as needed, for about 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Carefully flip the pastry onto a plate.</li>
        <li>Place the pan back over medium low heat and cook until golden on the bottom, another 4-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from heat and immediately pour the desired amount of cooled syrup over the pastry to soak.</li>
        <li>Serve the Künefe hot while the cheese is still melted and stretchy.</li>
    </ol>
